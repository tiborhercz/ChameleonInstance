# ChameleonInstance

The ChameleonInstance is an instance you can deploy in an AWS account to do some testing within the account and VPC.
SSM works out of the box if the ChameleonInstance has a Public IP address or it has access to a VPC endpoint.

It is a temporary instance which is not meant for running any production systems on it, the instance is not hardened!
